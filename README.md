ðŸ“¦ Project: 5x5 Grid Logistic Robot
This project is a small-scale autonomous logistic robot designed to navigate a 5Ã—5 line-marked grid. It detects, picks up, and delivers colored cubes (red or blue) to matching drop-off zones using computer vision and onboard sensors. The robot uses a Raspberry Pi for high-level planning and vision, and an Arduino Nano for real-time control of movement and actuation.

ðŸ§  Key Features
IR line following with intersection tracking

Object detection via Pi Camera + OpenCV

Accurate 90Â° turns using MPU6050

Obstacle detection using Sharp IR sensor

Servo-based claw and arm for pick-and-drop

Shortest-path planning to navigate between nodes

Resilient to edge cases like misalignment, repeated detection, and lighting variation
