# 📦 Project: 5x5 Grid Logistic Robot

## 📖 Description
This project is a small-scale autonomous logistic robot designed to navigate a 5×5 line-marked grid. It detects, picks up, and delivers colored cubes (red or blue) to matching drop-off zones using computer vision and onboard sensors. The robot uses a Raspberry Pi for high-level planning and vision, and an Arduino Nano for real-time control of movement and actuation.

## 🧠 Key Features
- IR line following with intersection tracking
- Object detection via Pi Camera + OpenCV
- Accurate 90° turns using MPU6050
- Obstacle detection using Sharp IR sensor
- Servo-based claw and arm for pick-and-drop
- Shortest-path planning to navigate between nodes
- Resilient to edge cases like misalignment, repeated detection, and lighting variation

## 🔧 Hardware Used
- Raspberry Pi
- Arduino Nano
- 5-sensor IR array
- MPU6050 (gyro)
- Sharp IR distance sensor
- Pi Camera
- 2x Servo motors (arm + claw)
- L298N motor driver
